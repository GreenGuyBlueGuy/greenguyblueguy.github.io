            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>My games are inspired by conversations, usually while driving, with my kids.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I have been teaching myself programming and art since I can remember.
                My first commercial release was in 2015, using Solar 2D to create a simple video tutorial mobile app.
            </p>
            <p>To teach my kids how to make games, I started showing them RPG Maker and Roblox.</p>
            <div class="robloxGameContainer">
                <div>
                    <h3>The Last Plant:</h3>
                    <p>We joined the Global Game Jam and had a blast! The theme was "Roots," so we created The Last
                        Plant.</p>
                    <p>Our kids made a lot of the artwork and sound effects, check it out
                        <a href="/pages/games/lastplant.htm">here</a>.

            <h3>Roblox Games:</h3>
            <p>Roblox is a great introduction to game development for all ages. You will find Roblox provides an engine
                simple enough for kids and complex enough for a game studio.</p>
            <p>The games below were just made for fun.</p>

            <h2>Currently</h2>
            <p>Floaty Fluff is available on Apple and Android (basically like Flappy Bird, but we added a cat and
                candy).
                Snakes with Fists! is a Beat 'em Up game currently in development.
                Tale of the Story Legend is a top-down 2D adventure in pre-production.
                Go to the games page to learn more!</p>
            <p>We started from humble beginnings and have had a ton of fun along the way.</p>
            <p>We hope you love our games as much as we do!</p>
            <p>If you want to make games, there are plenty of resources out there - nothing stopping you!</p>
