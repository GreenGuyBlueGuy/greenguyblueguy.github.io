            <h2>What is Floaty Fluff?</h2>
            <p>A casual one-touch mobile game where players avoid obstacles by tapping the screen. Also, there are some
                cat
                puns on the menu screen, so... you're welcome.</p>
            <h2>The Pitch:</h2>
            <p>Point #1 - People love cats, or they hate them.</p>
            <p>Point #2 - Balloons are fun (subjective - but generally that is their intent)</p>
            <p>Currently, there are no ‘cats tied to a balloon’ games.</p>
            <p>So the market is wide open! </p>
            <p>We think you can connect the dots, this idea translates into $$$$</p>
            <h2>Design:</h2>
            <p>The design is simple, for casual gameing. Avoid obstacles, earn points, read some cat puns, enjoy your
                life.
                Puns make people annoyed or overjoyed - evoking any emotion is a path to success (see Point #1)
            </p>
            </p>
            <h2>The Team:</h2>
            <p>Green Guy Blue Guy is a family company - literally, not figuratively like “you are like family when you
                work
                here”. We are literally family.
                We don’t have a cat. Sorry to say, because it’s like “hey a cat game, I bet the creators have a ton of
                cats”. But we don’t even have one. We have all been around cats, grown up with them, and even had them
                in
                the past. Some of us are even allergic to cats - and how do you figure that out? That’s right you have
                to
                have hugged a cat. All of that being said, we do think cats are pretty swell.</p>
            <h2>Game Engine:</h2>
            <p>We made this in Godot. The original concept was made in Solar 2d, which is a great open source engine for
                cross-platform development. We moved to godot because Solar 2d was having some issues (crashing) after
                an
                operating system update.</p>
