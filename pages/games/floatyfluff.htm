                <h2>What is Floaty Fluff?</h2>
                <p>A casual one-touch mobile game where players avoid obstacles by tapping the screen.</p>
                <img src="/images/floatyFluffArticle.png" width="50%" />

                <h2>The Pitch:</h2>
                <p>Point #1 - People love cats, or they hate them.</p>
                <p>Point #2 - Balloons are fun (subjective - but generally that is their intent)</p>
                <p>Currently, there are no ‘cats tied to a balloon’ games.</p>
                <p>So the market is wide open! </p>
                <p>We think you can connect the dots, this idea translates into $$$$</p>
                <h2>The Team:</h2>
                <p>Green Guy Blue Guy is a family company - literally, not figuratively. We do not say things like “you
                    are
                    like family when you
                    work
                    here”. We are literally family.</p>
                <p>
                    We don’t have a cat. Sorry to say, because I know what you are thinking “hey wow, a cat game, I bet
                    the
                    creators have a ton of
                    cats”. The truth is, we don’t even have ONE cat. We love cats, but some of us are allergic to cats -
                    and
                    how do you figure that out? That’s right you've hugged a cat, or pet a cat then rubbed your eyes,
                    oof.
                    All of that being said, we do think cats are
                    pretty swell.</p>
                <h2>Game Engine:</h2>
                <p>We made this in Godot. The original concept was made in Solar 2d, which is a great open source engine
                    for
                    cross-platform development. We moved to godot because Solar 2d was having some issues (crashing)
                    after
                    an
                    operating system update.</p>
