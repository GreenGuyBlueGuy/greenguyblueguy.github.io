            <h2>Snakes with Fists!</h2>

            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>Snakes with fists is an exploration Beat 'em Up RPG. The in game battle system pays tribute to the great
                Beat 'em Up style games from the late 80's and early 90's
                (Battletodas, TMNT, Double Dragon, etc.). Update your character stats, explore an open world, unlock
                secrets, and meet interesting characters in this unique adventure. </p>
            <h3>Something Slither This Way Comes!</h3>
            <p>Cobruh and Conduh are up to their fangs in adventure as they slither from Morbat's city shadows and enter
                into
                The
                Hive Lord’s subterranean network. You will have to PUNCH your way through 12 snake bitten levels,
                fighting
                the Sludge Syndicate on your path to reach The Hive Lord.</p>
            <h3>Fists and Fangs!</h3>
            <p>The Sludge Syndicate doesn’t stand a chance against the power attacks dished out by the Snakes with
                Fists!
                The Knuckle Sandwich, Dash of Fist, and Ground Pound will enable the heroes to , slam, and shut-down the
                subterranean scum. More moves are learned along the way allowing you to customize your playstyle by
                selecting your snake's abilities at the start of each round.</p>
            <h3>TWO SNAKES ARE BETTER THAN ONE!</h3>
            <p>Two player mode is not necessary, but it is more fun! Each unique duo, depending on the abilities you
                each
                select, enables a different special Double Trouble Attack!</p>
