            <h2>Snakes with Fists!</h2>
            <h3>Opening Story</h3>
            <p> 1992, in the grimy metropolis of Morbat, lived two brothers, Cobruh and Conduh. Cobruh and Conduh are
                former gang members, raised in a crime den known as the Sludge Syndicate. They have turned away from
                that lifestyle and are now in hiding - taking refuge in the Hinterland Hills outside of town. These
                street-smart survivors are bound by blood and a shared determination to protect their new community.
            </p>
            <p>Each day, Cobruh spends long hours fixing broken-down vehicles in a rundown garage, while Conduh
                teaches science and technology to the local kids. Cobruh and Conduh also teach self-defense classes to
                locals hoping to give them a fighting chance against the city’s dangers. They look out for each other
                and their neighbors, finding small moments of peace in their gritty reality.</p>
            <p>
                One fateful night, their world was turned upside down. A massive explosion rocked their
                neighborhood. The blast originated from the little community center (where they teach self defense
                classes), reducing it to rubble. Amid the chaos and destruction, they found many items were stolen. The
                symbol of the Sludge Syndicate was spray painted on one of the broken brick walls leaving no mystery for
                who was to blame.</p>
            <p>They realized this was no random act but a deliberate attack. Believing that
                there was no escaping the reach of the Sludge Syndicate, the brothers embarked on a relentless mission
                to end the crime ring. Their mission led them to a hidden underground network beneath the city, filled
                with dark secrets and new dangerous adversaries....</p>
            <h3>What is Snakes with Fists?</h3>
            <p>Snakes with fists is an exploration Beat 'em Up RPG. The in game battle system pays tribute to the great
                Beat 'em Up style games from the late 80's and early 90's
                (Battletodas, TMNT, Double Dragon, etc.). Update your character stats, explore an open world, unlock
                secrets, and meet interesting characters in this unique adventure. </p>
            <h3>Something Slither This Way Comes!</h3>
            <p>Cobruh and Conduh are up to their fangs in adventure as they slither from Morbat's city shadows and enter
                into labyrinth subterranean network. You will have to PUNCH your way through 12 snake bitten levels,
                fighting the Sludge Syndicate on your path to uncovering the truth.</p>
            <h3>Fists and Fangs!</h3>
            <p>The Sludge Syndicate doesn’t stand a chance against the power attacks dished out by the Snakes with
                Fists! The Knuckle Sandwich, Dash of Fist, and Ground Pound will enable the heroes to, slam, and
                shut-down the
                subterranean scum. You can increase stats for your favorite moves allowing you to customize your
                playstyle!</p>
            <!-- <h3>TWO SNAKES ARE BETTER THAN ONE!</h3>
            <p>Two player mode is not necessary, but it is more fun! Each unique duo, depending on the abilities you
                each select, enables a different special Double Trouble Attack!</p> -->
