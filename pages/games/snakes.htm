            <h3>The Game Play</h3>
            <p> Snakes with Fists is an adventure RPG with a beat 'em up battle system! This game combines the
                open-world exploration elements of an RPG—interesting NPCs, side quests, secrets, and a strong
                narrative—with the fun of fighting in the beat 'em up style! </p>

            <h3>The Opening Story</h3>
            <p>
                On a purple planet, in the city of Morbat, lived Cobruh and Conduh, two brothers raised in a crime
                family called the Sludge Syndicate. They turned away from the criminal organization and are now in
                hiding, living a simpler life in the Hinterland Hills outside of town.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each day, Cobruh works in his shop fixing broken-down vehicles, while Conduh teaches science and
                technology to the local children. Each evening, they hold a self-defense class, hoping to give citizens
                a fighting chance against the city’s dangers.
            </p>
            <p>
                One night, a massive explosion rocked the neighborhood. Amid the chaos and destruction, a symbol of the
                Sludge Syndicate was spray-painted on one of the walls, leaving no mystery about who was to blame.
                Realizing that there was no escaping the reach of the Sludge Syndicate, the brothers embarked on a
                relentless mission to end the crime ring—leading them on a journey filled with dark secrets and new,
                dangerous adversaries.
            </p>

            <!-- <h3>Fists and Fangs!</h3>
            <p>The Sludge Syndicate doesn’t stand a chance against the power attacks dished out by the Snakes with
                Fists! The Knuckle Sandwich, Dash of Fist, and Ground Pound will enable the heroes to, slam, and
                shut-down the
                subterranean scum. You can increase stats for your favorite moves allowing you to customize your
                playstyle!</p> -->
            <!-- <h3>World Layout Example</h3>
            <p>The style on this map needs to be updated with modern buldings some roadways and more detail, but here is
                the layout for the world:

            <!-- </p> -->
            <!-- <h3>Two Snakes are better than one!</h3>
            <p>Snakes with Fists can be played with 1-2 Players. Two player mode is not necessary, but it is more fun!
            </p> -->
