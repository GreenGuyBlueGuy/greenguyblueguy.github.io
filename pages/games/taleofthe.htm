            <h2>Tale of the Story Legend</h2>
            <p>Fulfill the prophecy, or don’t.. It's up to you. Battle your way through challenging stages and connect
                with
                unique characters along the way. Will you save them, or will you pursue your own agenda. Will you become
                a
                cautionary tale or will you become a legend? The story has yet to be written…</p>
            <h2>No spoilers here! This game is in pre-production and we cannot wait to share more details as we begin
