                <h2>Global Game Jam 2025</h2>

                <p>Participating in the Global Game Jam 2025 was an incredible experience. This year’s theme was
                    "Bubbles," and it was exciting to collaborate with other developers to bring a creative idea to
                    life.</p>

                <p>The event was hosted by the Greater Gaming Society in San Antonio at the UTSA campus. My friend Nick
                    and I arrived just in time for the theme reveal, after a bit of chaos involving parking shenanigans.
                    We decided to avoid the $2.50/hour garage fee, which led us to park farther away and walk half a
                    mile to the venue. Despite the hassle, the anticipation made it worth it.</p>

                <p>As soon as the theme "Bubbles" was announced, Nick and I started brainstorming ideas. Shortly after,
                    we were approached by two other developers, Adam and Sebastian, who were looking for a team.
                    Thrilled to have more collaborators, we joined forces and began throwing around concepts for our
                    game.</p>

                <p>After some lively discussions, we decided to explore the theme in three distinct ways. First, we took
                    a direct approach by making the main character a bubble. Second, we opted for an indirect approach
                    by introducing a narrator whose instructions the player would disobey, essentially "bursting" the
                    narrator’s bubble. Finally, we added a reflective element by incorporating deep, philosophical
                    quotes displayed in "thought bubbles" between stages. This multi-faceted approach gave our game
                    depth and allowed us to connect the theme to broader ideas about life and existence.</p>

                <p>The concept of bubbles as a finite existence resonated with me personally. I remembered how, as a
                    child, I would try to catch bubbles on the bubble wand, attempting to keep them "alive" as long as
                    possible. This memory inspired a thought: what if bubbles embraced their short-lived nature? What if
                    it was actually cruel to prevent them from popping? This philosophical twist became the foundation
                    of our game, <i>Bubble Down</i>.</p>

                <p>Drawing inspiration from narrator-driven games like <i>The Stanley Parable</i> and fast-paced falling
                    games like <i>Downwell</i>, we quickly got to work. Our team dove into development with enthusiasm,
                    and over the course of the jam, we brought our vision to life. Despite the tight timeline, we
                    managed to finish just in time to submit our game for local judging.</p>

                <p>After submission, we had the chance to watch other teams showcase their amazing projects, which was
                    both inspiring and nerve-wracking. When it was our turn to present <i>Bubble Down</i>, we shared our
                    creative process and gameplay mechanics with the audience. The response was overwhelmingly positive,
                    and to our delight, we walked away with the "Most Creative" award. It was a proud moment for our
                    team and a validation of the hard work we had put in.</p>
