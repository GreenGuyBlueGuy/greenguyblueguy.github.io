                <h2>A New Take on Classic Genres</h2>

                <p>If you’re a fan of classic video games, Snakes with Fists is going to be right up your alley. We
                    wanted to capture the magic of those old-school RPGs and Beat ‘em Ups we grew up with, but with a
                    twist. In Snakes with Fists, you’ll explore a richly detailed RPG world filled with secrets, side
                    quests, and a compelling narrative. But instead of engaging in the usual turn-based battles, you’ll
                    be pulled into intense Beat ‘em Up style fighting stages. Clear the stage, and you’re back in the
                    RPG world to continue your adventure.</p>

                <p>This unique blend of genres isn’t something you see every day, and that’s exactly what makes Snakes
                    with Fists special. We’re merging the strategic depth of RPGs with the fast-paced action of Beat ‘em
                    Ups, all wrapped up in stunning pixel art and set to a nostalgic chiptune soundtrack.</p>

                <h3>Developed with Godot</h3>

                <p>Behind the scenes, Snakes with Fists is being developed using the Godot game engine. As an indie
                    developer, Godot has been the perfect choice. We’ve been able to fine-tune the game’s mechanics,
                    design quirky characters, and create those funny moments that we hope will bring a smile to your
                    face—all thanks to the power of Godot.</p>

                <h3>A Word from the Developer</h3>

                <p>"This game brings together two of my all-time favorite genres in a way that's never been done before.
                    The most fun part has been crafting quirky characters and funny moments, many of which are inspired
                    by the out-of-the-box thinking of my kids. We’ve previously released a mobile game called Floaty
                    Fluff and participated in game jams like The Global Game Jam, where we entered The Last Plant. But
                    Snakes with Fists is our most ambitious project yet, and we can’t wait for you to play it."</p>

                <h3>Stay Tuned!</h3>

                <p>As we get closer to launch, we’ll be sharing more updates, sneak peeks, and behind-the-scenes looks
                    at the development process.</p>

                <p>Thanks for being part of our journey, and we look forward to bringing you more exciting news soon!
