                <h1>Why I Chose a Small Flappy Bird Game for My First Video Game Project</h1>
                <p>Author: Joe Little</p>
                <p>Date: 05/19/24</p>
                <p>I know, I know, it is almost comical at this point, there are so many Flappy Bird clones. However,
                    you must
                    understand there are many good reasons behind choosing such a game project for my first release.
                    There are
                    currently 3 rather large games that I have in my production pipeline. While talking to my kids, I
                    was telling them how important it is to just finish games. Make small games and publish them. I
                    remember saying
                    "you could even take a simple game like flappy-bird and add a new mechanic". This conversation
                    opened the idea taht I should live by example. That is how making and releasing Floaty Fluff my
                    Flappy Bird like game began. This choice allowed me to focus on creating a Minimum Viable Product
                    (MVP) and avoid the pitfalls of scope creep, ensuring a successful and
                    manageable initial project.
                </p>
                <h2>Simplicity and Focus</h2>
                <p>The gameâ€™s mechanics are straightforward: Fluff floats on a balloon, tap to make Fluff drop down
                    (like upside down Flappy Bird) and prevent the cat from hitting the ceiling, while also avoiding
                    obstacles. Every 5 points the game speeds up, collect candy to slow
                    teh game speed back down.</p>
                <p>Focusing on a game with basic mechanics allowed me to
                    concentrate on mastering fundamental aspects of game development, such as coding, design, and pixel
                    art, without getting overwhelmed by complex systems or features.</p>

                <h2>Learning Core Principles</h2>
                <p>Developing Floaty Fluff helped me grasp essential game development principles. This includes
                    collision detection, physics, and user input handling. Understanding these core concepts is vital
                    for any game developer, and a small project provides a manageable scope to practice and refine these
                    skills. Moreover, it allowed me to experience the entire game development lifecycle, from initial
                    concept to final polish.</p>

                <h2>Avoiding Scope Creep</h2>
                <p>Scope creep is a common issue in game development, where additional features and ideas extend beyond
                    the original project scope, leading to delays and unfinished projects. By choosing a small,
                    well-defined project, I minimized the risk of scope creep. I set clear, achievable goals and focused
                    on executing them to the best of my ability. This disciplined approach ensured that I completed my
                    project on time and learned the importance of project management in game development.</p>

                <h2>Game Development - Game Engines</h2>
                <p>Choosing a game engine, if you are not skilled enough to build your own, is a decision every game
                    developer faces. My decision to switch to the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a>, a
                    free and open-source cross-platform engine, came after encountering significant challenges with
                    publishing my game using Solar 2D (Solar 2d is also open source and cross-platform). Although I had
                    initially developed the entire game in Solar 2D, I found the process of getting the game ready for
                    release cumbersome and frustrating. Godot offered a more streamlined and user-friendly publishing
                    experience, alongside its robust set of tools and active community support. Its flexibility and
                    comprehensive documentation made the transition smoother and allowed me to enhance my game's
                    overall performance.</p>

                <h2>Building Confidence</h2>
                <p>Completing a project, no matter how small, is a significant confidence booster. Finishing Floaty
                    Fluff and publishing it for Apple and Google Play, demonstrated that I could take a game from
                    concept to completion. This success provided me with the motivation and confidence to tackle more
                    complex projects in the future. It is also a portfolio piece that showcases my skills and dedication
                    to potential collaborators.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Choosing to develop a small game like Flappy Bird as my first project allowed me to learn and apply
                    fundamental game development principles, avoid scope creep, and build confidence in my abilities.
                    For any aspiring indie game developer, starting with a small, manageable project is a critical step
                    towards achieving long-term success in the industry. By focusing on creating an MVP, you can ensure
                    steady progress and lay a solid foundation for more ambitious projects in the future.</p>
