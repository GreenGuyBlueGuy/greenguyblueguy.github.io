                <h2>Games That Built My Game Dev Dreams</h2>
                <p>Author: Joe Littls</p>
                <p>Date: 01/28/24</p>
                <p>Video games have always been an important part of my life. Two gifts from my childhood stand out in
                    particular. The first a classic Game Boy clutched
                    in my eager little hands. It housed a universe within its plastic shell. Tetris, with its addictive
                    dance of falling blocks, and Zelda: Link's Awakening, an epic adventure eclosed in tiny green and
                    black
                    squares. The Game
                    Boy became constant companion. My tiny gray adventurer went everywhere with me, tucked like a secret
                    world into my pocket. Whether riding in the
                    car's backseat or building forts in the woods, I could always slip back into Koholint Island, a
                    click
                    and a chime
                    transporting me to its lush fields and hidden secrets.</p>

                <p>The second gift, from my uncle, a treasure trove of computer game discs, unlocking a Pandora's Box of
                    digital
                    delights. There were several games including a Demodisk for Doom. Doom was like a forbidden fruit, I
                    played it in secret knowing my parents would not approve! Eventually I worked up the courage to ask
                    for
                    the full game, which, to my suprise, my parents hesitantly gave me permision Doom ignited my passion
                    for the PC. But it was StarCraft and WarCraft that truly sustained my open my pc game interest,
                    revealing galaxies
                    of strategic depth.</p>


                <!-- Each
                click a calculated move, each unit a cherished knight in a cosmic chess match, these games ignited a
                fire within me. From pixelated plumber to intergalactic commander, my childhood was a thrilling symphony
                of digital adventures.</p> -->
                <!-- <p>Two of my favorite gifts growing up were video game related; the first one, an origional gameboy with
                Tetris and Zelda
                from my parents, and teh second, a stack of computer games from my uncle. I carries my Gameboy
                everywhere with me, and I was
                completely blown away by Zelda: Link's Awakening. This game is synonymous with my childhood, whether I
                was in the car, or playing in the woods, I was always ready to jump back in to the amazing world of
                Zelda. The computer games that my uncle gave me inluded Doom (my parents didn't know) and I became
                obseesed with computer games too! StarCraft and WarCraft, blew open the doors to strategy, revealing
                worlds where every click was a chess move, every unit a precious pawn in a galactic game of domination.
            </p> -->

                <p>In my earaly childhood, the first game I ever bought with my own money, was the Super
                    Mario Bros. / Duck Hunt combo NES game. I spent my own money on the game so my parents bought the
                    orange
                    duckhunt gun! Ah, Super Mario Bros. The
                    name alone conjures up a symphony of blips and bloops, the satisfying thwack of striking a Goomba a
                    fireball, and the triumphant flourish as Princess Peach finally escapes Bowser's clutches. For me,
                    Mario
                    wasn't just a husky plumber; he was a portal to a world of pixelated possibilities, the first spark
                    in a
                    crackling bonfire of game development passion. Contrary to popular opinion, I also realy loved Super
                    Mario 2! I loved all of the uniqe enemy characters, and the fact that princess peach could float for
                    a
                    long distance. Super Mario Bros. 3 really bew my sox off! It was a tremendous expansion on the
                    series,
                    explosive bursts of imagination full of warp whistles, enemies that were quirky and lovable, and
                    power-ups could turn you into a frog, tanuki, or a hammer-wielding powerhouse!</p>

                <p>Another NES game at the top of my list is Bucky-O'Hare. That swashbuckling space rabbit with a
                    robo-parrot and a laser gun the size of his arm. He may not have reached the same stratospheric
                    heights
                    as Mario or Link,
                    but for me, Bucky was a revelation. A side-scrolling symphony of explosions, cheesy one-liners, and
                    quirky
                    alien enemies, Bucky's NES adventure was a playground of pure, unadulterated fun. The gameplay and
                    the
                    soundtrack are playing in my mind when I think back to my childhood.</p>

                <p>Then came Battletoads, proving side-scrolling brawling could be a glorious ballet of butt-stomps and
                    weaponized pimples. I lvoed this game, even though it was really, really, really, difficult! I loved
                    the
                    battle system and the satisfaction of a perfeclty timed boot!</p>

                <p>But it wasn't just about pixelated sprites and chip-tunes. Ocarina of Time painted Hyrule in
                    breathtaking 3D, Zelda whispering to the wind while Link galloped on Epona, my childhood heart
                    swelling
                    with every epic quest and dungeon dive. GoldenEye on N64 wasn't just a shooter; it was the first
                    tiem I
                    stayed up all night gaminf with firends and eating pizza!
                    And Halo, oh Halo, transported me to a sprawling alien ringworld, and was a reason to host a living
                    room
                    LAN party, a cacophony of friendly (and maybe not so friendly) fire as we battled for supremacy in
                    Blood
                    Gultch. </p>

                <p>Each game was a brushstroke on my imagination, a lesson scribbled in pixels and polygons. From
                    Mario's
                    side-scrolling symphony to Zelda's sweeping epics, from Battletoads' riotous brawls to Halo's sci-fi
                    grandeur, they taught me about worlds, characters, challenges, and the sheer, unadulterated joy of a
                    well-crafted game.</p>

                <p>Now, as an indie developer, I stand bathed in the afterglow of that pixelated Pantheon. Every line of
                    code, every level design, every enemy sprite whispers in the echoes of Super Mario's warp pipes,
                    StarCraft's strategic dances, and Ocarina of Time's epic melodies. My goal isn't to copy these
                    giants;
                    it's to capture their spark, the spirit of innovation, the thrill of discovery, and the gut-punching
                    joy
                    that makes a game unforgettable.</p>

                <p>So, here's to the Super Marios, the Battletoads, the StarCrafts, and all the games that lit the fire
                    in
                    my soul. You're not just pixels on a screen; you're the blueprint for the worlds I strive to create,
                    the
                    inspiration that fuels my every keystroke. And who knows, maybe one day, a kid playing my game will
                    look
                    back and say, "That's where it all started, the game that sparked my own dream of building pixelated
                    playgrounds.</p>
