                <h2>From Crawlers to Knuckleheads - the growth of <em>Snakes with Fists</em></h2>

                <p>When I first started building Snakes with Fists, the demo was about as simple as it gets: a single
                    player character, a basic punch, and one kind of enemy — the humble crawler.
                    It was fun, but it was also bare-bones. I knew there was room to grow… I just didn’t know how much.
                </p>

                <p>Fast forward through DreamHack Dallas and DreamHack Atlanta, and suddenly the vision started
                    expanding in ways I hadn’t imagined. Watching hundreds of people play the game — from speed-running
                    teens to parents trying it with their kids — gave me a ton of real-time feedback. Players didn’t
                    just tell me what they liked, they showed me, and that shaped where the game went next.
                </p>
                <h3>Player Feedback → New Mechanics </h3>
                <p>One of the biggest things I noticed at DreamHack was how much players loved risk-reward mechanics.
                    People lit up when they got a perfectly timed block or landed a satisfying hit. So, I added the
                    Perfect Parry — nail the timing, and not only will you deflect the attack, you’ll restore a little
                    health.</p>

                <p>That idea snowballed into another new mechanic: the Finishing Punch. Land this on a weakened enemy,
                    and you get a stylish, over-the-top knockout plus a health boost. Both features reward skill,
                    timing, and a bit of daring.</p>
                <h3>Expanding the Enemy Roster</h3>
                <p>At the start, our poor crawlers were taking all the punches. Now they’ve got company — and some of
                    it’s not so friendly:

                    Knucklehead Bruisers – Prefer hand to hand and hit like a truck.

                    Knucklehead Sluggers – Carry bats and love to knock you around.

                    Knucklehead Gunners – Keep their distance and pepper you with projectiles.

                    Each new enemy forces players to adapt their strategies — and watching that play out in the booth
                    was incredibly rewarding.
                </p>
                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>Every one of these additions — from the Perfect Parry to the expanded enemy roster — came from seeing
                    how people engaged with the game. DreamHack wasn’t just about showing off Snakes with Fists; it was
                    about building it together with the people who will eventually play it.

                    The demo has come a long way from those early days of just punch vs. crawler, and there’s still more
                    to come. The more I see players laugh, shout, and yell “NO WAY!” at a surprise enemy attack, the
                    more I know we’re on the right track.

                    Thanks to everyone who’s tried the game so far and given feedback — you’ve made Snakes with Fists
                    better than I could have done alone.

                    Next stop: more chaos, more enemies, and maybe… just maybe… even bigger fists. 🐍🥊
