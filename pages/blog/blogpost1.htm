                <h2>From AAA blockbusters to backyard adventures: a family game developer's perspective</h2>
                <p>Author: Joe Little</p>
                <p>Date: 12/01/23</p>

                <p>Remember those epic battles you'd have with your siblings through an NES or Playstaion controller on
                    your
                    living room television,
                    desperately seeking to win pixelated glory? Yeah, me too. Now, as an indie game developer, I get to
                    combine that childhood thrill with the magic of creating worlds for families to explore together.
                </p>

                <p>AAA games are great, and hold some of my most cherished memories. More and more it feels like AAA
                    games
                    are the glittering theme parks of the gaming universe, dazzling you with rollercoasters of graphics
                    and
                    storylines so rich you could drown in them. And there's no denying, they're awesome. But sometimes,
                    after all the explosions and epic boss fights, you just want to build a sandcastle together, right?
                </p>

                <p>That's where the indie world comes in. It's like your backyard, full of possibilities waiting to be
                    unearthed. We tinker, we experiment, we let our imaginations run wild. Wacky characters your kids
                    thought of as an imaginary friend, storylines crazier than the adventures you dream up while looking
                    up
                    at the stars, and gameplay that's as fun for a five-year-old as it is for a middle-aged parent.
                <p>Of course, we don't have the same budgets as those theme parks. But that's the beauty of the
                    backyard:
                    it's all about resourcefulness and imagination. We turn cardboard boxes into spaceships, old socks
                    into
                    puppets, and bedtime stories into pixelated worlds. And because we're small and nimble, we can take
                    risks, try new things, and let our inner child run free.</p>

                <p>Indie game development is the freedom to take risks. Indies can experiment with gameplay mechanics,
                    art
                    styles, and narratives in ways that larger studios might hesitate to. This freedom fosters a culture
                    of
                    innovation, giving rise to groundbreaking titles that leave a lasting impact on the gaming
                    community.
                </p>

                <p>When it comes down to it, the magic of great games transcends the labels of AAA or indie. It lies in
                    the
                    dedication of passionate creators who pour their hearts and souls into crafting worlds that players
                    can
                    get lost in. Whether it's the blockbuster spectacle of a AAA title or the indie gem that surprises
                    and
                    delights, what matters most is the joy that games bring to players around the globe.</p>
