                <h1>My game dev perspective</h1>
                <p>Author: Joe Little</p>
                <p>Date: 12/01/23</p>

                <p>I fondly remember epic battles and adventures I had with my brother and sister through our NES
                    console on our little boxy tv. There was a little game rental store half a block from my house,
                    visible from
                    my living room window! We used to take our birthday money and spare change there to rent games and
                    buy candy. It was perfect.
                    Now, as an indie game developer, I get to
                    combine my childhood appreciation of games using modern game dev tools to create fun worlds for
                    the next generation
                    to enjoy.
                </p>

                <p>I love indie games. My perfect weekend is spent exploring a new indie game with my kids. Don't get me
                    wrong, big budget games can be great,
                    and hold
                    some of my most cherished memories. However, more and more it feels like big studio games
                    are losing touch with their audience, prioritizing monetization over the gamer's experience.
                </p>

                <p>That's where indie developers differentiate themselves. Indie developers are not afraid to
                    experiment,
                    we let our imaginations run wild. Indie game development is the freedom to take risks. Indies can
                    experiment with gameplay mechanics, art styles, and narratives in ways that larger studios might
                    steer away from. This freedom fosters a culture
                    of innovation, giving rise to groundbreaking titles that leave a lasting impact on the gaming
                    community.
                </p>

                <p>When it comes down to it, the magic of great games lies in
                    the dedication of passionate creators who pour their hearts and souls into crafting worlds that
                    players
                    can get lost in and I feel honored to be a part if that.
