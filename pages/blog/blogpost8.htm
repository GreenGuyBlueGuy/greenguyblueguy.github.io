                <h2>Bringing <em>Snakes with Fists</em> to DreamHack Dallas: What a Weekend!</h2>

                <p><strong>DreamHack Dallas</strong> was an unforgettable experience — and <em>Snakes with Fists</em>
                    had its biggest moment yet.</p>

                <p>This was our first time showcasing at DreamHack Dallas, and the energy on the show floor was unreal.
                    From the moment the doors opened to the final hour, we had a steady stream of players lining up to
                    punch, dodge, and laugh their way through Morbat City. Seeing people’s reactions in real time — the
                    combos, the laughs, the surprised yells when they punched the old man too many times and he turned
                    into a mini boss fight — it was absolutely electric.</p>

                <p>This event was also special on a personal level. My wife and sons were right there with me, helping
                    to run the booth, greet players, and keep the energy high. Having them be a part of this journey —
                    seeing the game we’ve poured so much time and passion into finally in players’ hands — meant the
                    world.</p>

                <p>And I couldn’t have done it without my good friend <strong>Nick</strong>, who brought his A-game
                    every single day and made sure everything ran smoothly while keeping the hype alive.</p>

                <p>And then — the cherry on top — <em>Snakes with Fists</em> won an <strong>Audience Choice
                        Award</strong>! To say I’m honored is an understatement. There were so many incredible indie
                    games at the event, and to have people vote for ours as their favorite? It’s surreal. Thank you to
                    everyone who played, voted, and gave us their support. Your excitement and feedback fuels us as we
                    keep building and refining the game.</p>

                <p>DreamHack Dallas reminded me why I started this journey: to make something fun, something weird, and
                    something people genuinely enjoy. And judging by the smiles, fist bumps, and return visits we saw
                    all weekend — we’re on the right track.</p>

                <p><em>Can’t wait to show you what’s next.</em></p>
